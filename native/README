This is the README file for the binary distribution of GNAT.
This directory contains the files needed for installing and running GNAT.

INSTALLING

To install GNAT in a directory other than the one in which the
Installer has placed it, simply run the 'doinstall' script
(e.g. ./doinstall) contained in this directory. This script asks a few
questions about how you want GNAT to be installed. It prompts you for
confirmation before proceeding with the actual installation. At any
time before this confirmation, you can interrupt it by pressing
Ctrl-C.

The information you will be requested to provide is very simple. GNAT
needs only an installation directory, and for some cross targets,
the installation directory of the target operating system. The installation
script writes some temporary files and a complete report of its actions
(install.log) in the current directory by default; this can be overridden
by setting the TMPDIR environment variable to an appropriate writable
directory.

USE

Using GNAT is documented in the GNAT User's Guide available at
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn/.

GDB

gdb has to be 'code-signed' (unless you're willing to run it as root!)

See https://forward-in-code.blogspot.com/2018/11/mojave-vs-gdb.html
(section "Security").

EXAMPLES

The directory <installation root>/share/examples contains simple examples.
