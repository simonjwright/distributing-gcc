This is the README file for the arm-eabi binary distribution of GNAT.
This directory contains the files needed for installing and running GNAT.

INSTALLING

To install GNAT, simply run the 'doinstall' script (e.g. ./doinstall)
contained in this directory. This script asks a few questions about how
you want GNAT to be installed. It prompts you for confirmation before
proceeding with the actual installation. At any time before this
confirmation, you can interrupt it by pressing Ctrl-C.

The information you will be requested to provide is very simple. GNAT
needs only an installation directory, and for some cross targets,
the installation directory of the target operating system. The installation
script writes some temporary files and a complete report of its actions
(install.log) in the current directory by default; this can be overridden
by setting the TMPDIR environment variable to an appropriate writable
directory.

It is allowable to install this package at the same place as the
corresponding native compiler.

USE

Using GNAT is documented in the GNAT User's Guide available at
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gnat_ugn_unw/.

Note that the cross-compiler is supplied WITHOUT AN ADA RUN TIME SYSTEM
OR EXAMPLES. See the "STM32F4 GNAT Run Time Systems" project at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm32f4-gnat-rts/.
