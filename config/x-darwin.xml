  <!-- Darwin's management of shared libraries and runtime paths means
       that, to install GNAT in a place other than that for which it
       was built, we have to adjust paths in shared libraries and
       executables to match the new location, using
       install_name_tool(1).

       This can fail if there's insufficient space in the file to be
       modified to accommodate the new name. Darwin's cure for this is
       to use the ld switch -headerpad_max_install_names.

       This file is named x-darwin.xml because, if installed in
       $prefix/share/gprconfig/, the files are processed in
       alphabetical order and there seems to be no way to append the
       new switch to the existing ones, so the existing assignment has
       to be overridden, which means the new one has to be processed
       after the old one (in linker.xml).

       However, probably best not to install in the standard place,
       but instead to use during the tool builds; something like
         $ make BUILDER='gprbuild ==db $HOME/distributing-gcc/config'
       (but with s/=/-/g - dash dash is illegal in XML).
       NB, for unknown reasons, the switch may appear multiple times
       while building executables.
