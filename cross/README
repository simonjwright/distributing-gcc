This is the README file for the arm-eabi binary distribution of GNAT.
This directory contains the files needed for installing and running
GNAT. It must be installed over the corresponding native compiler.

INSTALLING

To install GNAT, simply run the 'doinstall' script (e.g. ./doinstall)
contained in this directory. This script asks a few questions about how
you want GNAT to be installed. It prompts you for confirmation before
proceeding with the actual installation. At any time before this
confirmation, you can interrupt it by pressing Ctrl-C.

The information you will be requested to provide is very simple. GNAT
needs only an installation directory, which for this cross-compiler
MUST be the same as that of the corresponding native compiler, and for
some cross targets, the installation directory of the target operating
system. The installation script writes some temporary files and a
complete report of its actions (install.log) in the current directory
by default; this can be overridden by setting the TMPDIR environment
variable to an appropriate writable directory.

USE

Using GNAT is documented in the GNAT User's Guide available at
https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/gnat_ugn/html/gnat_ugn/gnat_ugn.html.
See also the GNAT Userâ€™s Guide Supplement for Cross Platforms at
https://docs.adacore.com/live/wave/gnat_ugx/html/gnat_ugx/gnat_ugx.html.

The cross-compiler is supplied with runtimes and examples from the
Linux arm-elf distribution. See also the "Cortex GNAT Run Time
Systems" project at https://github.com/simonjwright/cortex-gnat-rts.
